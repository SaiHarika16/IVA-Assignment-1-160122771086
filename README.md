# Image and Video Analytics Assignment-1

## Overview
This project contains practical implementations for various fundamental tasks in Image and Video Analytics using Python and OpenCV. The tasks are organized in the Jupyter notebook `IVA Assignment-1.ipynb` and cover color detection, image pyramids, smoothing, edge detection, and object detection.

## Features
- Color detection from images using a color dataset
- T-Pyramid (multi-resolution) image generation
- Image smoothing with bilateral filtering
- Edge detection using Sobel and Canny methods
- Object detection (faces, eyes, smiles) using Haar cascades

## Tech Stack
- **Language:** Python 3.x
- **Libraries:**
  - OpenCV (`opencv-python`)
  - NumPy
  - Pandas
  - Matplotlib
- **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab

## Files
- `IVA Assignment-1.ipynb`: Main Jupyter notebook with all code and explanations.
- `colors.csv`: Dataset of color names and RGB/hex values for color detection.
- `colorpics.jpg`, `image.png`, `photo.jpg`, `dragon.jpg`, `woman.jpg`: Sample images used in the notebook.
- `output1.jpg`: Example output image (if generated by the notebook).

## Setup
1. Clone or download this repository and ensure all files are in the same directory.
2. Install the required Python libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install opencv-python numpy pandas matplotlib
   ```
3. (Optional) Use a virtual environment for isolation.

## Usage
1. Open `IVA Assignment-1.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or upload it to Google Colab.
2. Ensure all required images and the `colors.csv` file are in the same directory as the notebook, or update the file paths in the code cells as needed.
3. Run each cell in the notebook sequentially to see the results and visualizations for each task.

**Note:**
- Some code cells reference file paths for Google Drive (e.g., `/content/drive/MyDrive/IVA Assignment-1/`). Update these paths if running locally.
- The notebook demonstrates basic computer vision techniques suitable for educational purposes.
